# Housing Dataset EDA Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a housing dataset.  
The main objective is to extract meaningful insights, understand data patterns, handle missing values, and visualize trends in the housing market
## Objective :
- Explore the structure of the dataset.  
- Perform **data cleaning**: handling null values, duplicates, and inconsistent datatypes.  
- Generate **descriptive statistics** for numerical and categorical variables.  
- Visualize housing data using **histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmaps**.  
- Identify **correlations** between different features such as house price, area, and rooms.  
- Summarize insights for better housing market understanding.

# Key Insights:
**Distribution of Median House Value**:
The histogram helps visualize the distribution of house values and detect skewness or peaks.
**Income vs House Value**:
The scatterplot displays how median income influences house values.
**Household Distribution**:
A histogram for households provides insight into the typical size of households in the dataset.
**Ocean Proximity**:
A bar chart visualizes how the proximity to the ocean influences housing count.
# Conclusion:
This EDA provides a foundational understanding of the housing dataset. Further insights can be drawn by applying more advanced statistical methods or machine learning models for predictions and analysis
